## 📚 Feature Engineering

This repository documents my structured learning journey in **Feature Engineering** — the art and science of preparing data to maximize a machine learning model’s performance. It covers **core theoretical foundations** alongside **practical implementations** using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and other ML tools.  

Feature Engineering is often considered the most critical step in the machine learning pipeline, as high-quality features can dramatically improve model accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.
